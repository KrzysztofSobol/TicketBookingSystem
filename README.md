# ticket booking system
 
TicketBookingSystem (TBS) is a program from the second semester of studies that allows for purchasing tickets for various randomly generated flights. Adding a GUI to the program was a last-minute idea, so it's not perfect but it works. It was created using tools available in the NetBeans IDE.

If you are a recruiter reviewing this project, I encourage you to check out the src/SYSTEM class, as it is the most interesting part for which I was responsible (Krzysztof S).
